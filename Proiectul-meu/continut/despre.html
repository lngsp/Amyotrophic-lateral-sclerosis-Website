            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;<b><i>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</i></b>, also known as <b><i>motor neurone disease (MND)</i></b> or <b><i>Lou Gehrig's disease</i></b>, is a 
                neurodegenerative disease that results in the progressive loss of motor neurons that control voluntary muscles. ALS is the 
                most common type of motor neuron disease. Early symptoms of ALS include stiff muscles, muscle twitches, and gradual increasing 
                weakness and muscle wasting. Half of the people with ALS develop at least mild difficulties with thinking and behavior, and about 
                15% develop frontotemporal dementia. The affected muscles are responsible for chewing food, speaking, and walking. Motor neuron loss 
                continues until the ability to eat, speak, move, and finally the ability to breathe is lost. ALS eventually causes paralysis and early 
                death, usually from respiratory failure.<br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;Most cases of ALS (about 90% to 95%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS. However, both genetic and environmental 
                factors are believed to be involved. There is no known cure for ALS. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms. The disease can affect people 
                of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50. In Europe, the disease affects about two to three people per 100000 per year.
                It became well known in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected baseball player Lou Gehrig (leading to his death two years later), 
                and later worldwide, following the 1963 diagnosis of then 21 year old cosmologist Stephen Hawking. However, unlike most ALS sufferers, Hawking managed to 
                survive his illness for another 55 years.
